# Jenkins Build with Workflow

The new Jenkins Workflow plug-in is available since december 2014. Here are some information about it:

* [Tutorial](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md)
* [Demo](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/tree/master/demo)

The current buildscript `jenkins_workflow.groovy` checks out the Git repository and build the sales and telesales project in parallel.
